Developed a scrabble bot as part of a team which works in the enviornment provided by our professor. 
Our bot works by interacting with the gatekeeper to obtain information about the board rather than accessing the board
info directly. 

--The file scrabble_ai is where our bot lives (this is the inly piece of code we developed directly)-- 
Scrabble_gui is where you can play against a bot or have to two bots play against each other
tournament.py is how you can run a round robin tournament of bots.
